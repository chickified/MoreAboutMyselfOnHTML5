                    <p>Hello stranger and welcome to my page! My name is Nestor Lee! I come from the small island state of Singapore! I am 23 years of age this year!</p>

                    <p>Like many other Singaporean males, I served my National Service before entering University. In the army, I was an Automotive Technician, 
                        maintaining our countries fleet of Bronco ATTC as well as the Leopard 2 MBTs!</p>

                    <p>I ORD-ed on the 3rd of September 2014 and spent 1 year working for various companies such as Certis Cisco and RBS inside their IT departments getting
                    some work related experience before finally securing a spot in a local university and starting my journey as a student again on the 7th of September 2015. </p>

                            <h2>Why did I choose SIT?</h2>
                        </hgroup>
                    </header>
                    <p>Firstly, the main reason why I chose to study ICT is because I was exposed to computing since young. So naturally, I decided to study Computing after completing
                    my O-Levels. After completing my diploma in Computer Engineering in SP, I enlisted into the army and in there, I decided to continue 
                    pursuing this field since I felt I had a passion for it.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>SIT is first and only undergraduate degree program offered by a local autonomous university at that time that majors in information security. Without much doubt, 
                    I made up my mind to apply and try to enter SIT.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Secondly, I think it is also good that the school tries to instill the "SIT-DNA" on its students. Even if someone might be intellectually gifted, if he does not have
                    a good upbringing, he might not become the most successful of a person.</p>

                    <p>Not long before I became a student once more, I went on a short trip to Batam in Indonesia. Mostly we did touristy things common in Batam, for example: go-karting, 
                        sight-seeing and also not forgetting, eating!</p>
